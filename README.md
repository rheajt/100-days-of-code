# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Set-up my livestreaming software and forked the repo on Github. Checked out some of the freecodecamp resources and projects that I will be working on.

I started a NextJS project for the front-end-libraries-projects and got nextjs working. I also pulled in some of the code from OLD OLD OLDDDDDD repos that still need to be deleted.

**Goals:** I want to become better at TypeScript and React. I also want to dive into GoLang.

### Day 0.5: January 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: This is the official first day. I had to take a few days from the initial test to restructure my plans. I am going to work on my portfolio and connect everything to a spreadsheet on the backend.

Got stuck working with `clasp` but I think tomorrow I'll be able to dive into TypeScript more deeply
