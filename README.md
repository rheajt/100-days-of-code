# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Set-up my livestreaming software and forked the repo on Github. Checked out some of the freecodecamp resources and projects that I will be working on.

I started a NextJS project for the front-end-libraries-projects and got nextjs working. I also pulled in some of the code from OLD OLD OLDDDDDD repos that still need to be deleted.

**Goals:** I want to become better at TypeScript and React. I also want to dive into GoLang.

### Day 0.5: January 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: This is the official first day. I had to take a few days from the initial test to restructure my plans. I am going to work on my portfolio and connect everything to a spreadsheet on the backend.

Got stuck working with `clasp` but I think tomorrow I'll be able to dive into TypeScript more deeply

### Day 1: January 16, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I wrote some types, interfaces, and enums in the code.ts file of my project. I started to add some functionality that allows the doGet and doPost triggers to handle requests from my frontend. Now the frontend can post data from the survey form. It can also handle a get request to get data from the different sheets in the spreadsheet.

**Tomorrow!** Keep working with types, interfaces, enums. Break them into their own definitions file to make things more readable. What are generics in Typescript? Find out!

**YouTube Link**: I failed to record! This is a signal that I need to understand a little bit more about the recording aspect.

### Day 2: January 17, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I got the tribute page loading data from the form.

**Tomorrow!** Keep working with types, interfaces, enums. Break them into their own definitions file to make things more readable. What are generics in Typescript? Find out!
